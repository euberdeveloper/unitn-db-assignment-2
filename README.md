The second assignment of the unitn exam "Basi di dati"

## Project purpose

This repo contains my solution for the **second assignment** of the unitn exam "Basi di dati". The assignment consisted in **[fifteen queries](https://github.com/euberdeveloper/unitn-db-assignment-2/blob/main/2020%20Assignment%202.pdf)**, that would have been evaluated automatically in a **PostgreSQL** server.

## The "consegna" (the questions)

The questions consisted in fifteen **SQL** queries, **[this](https://github.com/euberdeveloper/unitn-db-assignment-2/blob/main/2020%20Assignment%202.pdf)** is the original document.

## How are the solutions organized

The **SQL_201514** folder is the one that I submitted, the **datasets_with_query** folder is the one that allows you to test the queries. 

In order to test the queries:
- Open the **datasets_with_query** foder
- For each query
  - Run the create_db.sql in order to reset the db and create the tables
  - Run the populate_nationality.sql in order to populate the Nationality table
  - Run the populate_stadium.sql in order to populate the Stadium table
  - Run the populate_match.sql in order to populate the Match table
  - Run the sql query in query_xx.sql
  
We were not provided with datasets to test the queries, hence I created my own datasets, which were different for each query.

## The result

**I obtained the maximum score**
